<p>I am a masters degree candidate (May 2018) studying electrical and computer engineering at the University of Iowa with a broad research and employment background that ranges from computational and experimental neuroscience to artificial music generation. Having cultivated strong signal and image processing skills to complement an undergraduate background in physics, I aspire to contribute positive social impact through ethically grounded data science techniques. An avid bassist, pick-up basketball player, and pie baker, my research interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neuroscience.</p>
