The world of web design is completely new to me. So far it's been fun! Although installing dependencies for Jekyll and Ruby was actually kind of annoying... But I think I've got it figured out now! Anyway, given my limited design capabilities, these posts will be a bit of a learning process for me.

I recently published [my 5<sup>th</sup> post](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Muscle-Audio-Amplifier-Electromyography/) on [Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/). The Instructable walks through how to build an EMG audio amplifier. Check it out!
