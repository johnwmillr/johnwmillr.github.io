The world of web design is completely new to me. So far it's been fun! Although installing dependencies for Jekyll and Ruby was actually kind of annoying... But I think I've got it figured out now! Anyway, given my limited design capabilities, these posts will be a bit of a learning process for me.

I recently published [my 5<sup>th</sup> post](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Muscle-Audio-Amplifier-Electromyography/) on [Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/). The Instructable walks through how to build an EMG audio amplifier. Check it out!

A couple days after posting my Instructable, I found out it had been [featured on the HackADay blog](https://hackaday.com/2017/06/24/listen-to-your-body/)! They even sent the article out to their 114K followers on Twitter. Not bad!

From their article:
> This isn’t the first EMG rig we’ve seen, but John does a nice job of explaining why such a special amplifier is used and how it works. He also provides a lot of pointers to more detailed information, including a paper that covers the safety aspects of hooking yourself — or anyone — up to electronics.

How kind of them! I'm glad they appreciated my two passions: explaining complicated concepts and promoting safety. :)
