## [Python wrapper for Genius.com](http://www.johnwmillr.com/scraping-genius-lyrics/) -- **Fall 2017**
[![GeniusLogo](https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/220x0/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.rapgenius.com%2F716fe1fbbf4817447e21dd2f9aca0354.999x1000x1.png){:class="img-responsive" height="20%" width="20%"}](http://www.johnwmillr.com/scraping-genius-lyrics/)

[Genius.com](https://genius.com/) allows users to upload song lyrics and collaborate on annotations and interpretations of artists' words. I thought it'd be fun to write a Python wrapper for the API Genius.com provides. My code works as a simple Python package that users can import into their workspace with minimal configuration. The package allows users to programmatically access lyrics, artist information, and song media. The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnwmillr/GeniusAPI).

## [Active shape models for face detection](https://github.com/johnwmillr/ActiveShapeModels) -- **Spring 2017**
[![Faces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnwmillr/ActiveShapeModels/master/Media/Video/ASM_FaceDetection_24-Jul-2017_MUCT.gif){:class="img-responsive" height="30%" width="30%"}](https://github.com/johnwmillr/ActiveShapeModels)

For the final project in my Advanced Digital Image Processing course, I chose to research and implement active shape models (ASMs), a technique originally developed by [Tim Cootes et al. in 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314285710041). My Matlab code determines a point distribution model from a manually-labeled face training set and is then able to successfully locate faces in new images using the ASM technique. Check out the GitHub repository for a thorough description of the project.

## [EMG audio amplifier](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Muscle-Audio-Amplifier-Electromyography) -- **Spring 2017**

During the spring of 2017 I built an electromyography (EMG) audio amplifier. The two-channel device was built from analog integrated circuit components (op-amps, instrumentation amps, and audio amps), included band-pass filters, and could output audio through a standard 1/8" audio jack. Visit the link for images and schematics of the device as well as detailed instructions for building your own. After I published my project to the Instructables website, the HackADay blog [featured my work](https://hackaday.com/2017/06/24/listen-to-your-body) and Tweeted a link out to their 100K+ followers!

## [Muscle-controlled MIDI device](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Muscle-MIDI-Music/) -- **Winter 2017**
[![MIDImuscle](https://cdn.instructables.com/F7A/0QZB/IYKFXBWB/F7A0QZBIYKFXBWB.MEDIUM.jpg){:class="img-responsive" height="30%" width="30%"}](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Muscle-MIDI-Music/)

During the winter of 2017, I built an electromyography (EMG) amplifier which allowed users to trigger MIDI instrument sounds (e.g. a snare drum) by flexing their muscles. The device used muscle activity as a control signal for both volume and pitch of the MIDI notes. After the muscle activity was amplified and filtered via a custom-built analog circuit, an Arduino translated the EMG signals into MIDI signals which were then sent over Bluetooth to an iPhone running Garageband. I ended up winning a prize in the [Instructables Sensors 2017 contest](http://www.instructables.com/contest/sensors2017/).

## [Halloween drum machine costume](http://www.instructables.com/id/Functional-MIDI-Drum-Machine-Costume) -- **Fall 2016**
[![MIDIcostume](https://cdn.instructables.com/F30/YA8B/J44FX9TH/F30YA8BJ44FX9TH.MEDIUM.jpg){:class="img-responsive" height="22%" width="22%"}](http://www.instructables.com/id/Functional-MIDI-Drum-Machine-Costume)

For Halloween 2016 I designed and built a MIDI drum machine costume. The costume consisted of piezoelectric sensors worn on the chest which triggered MIDI drum machine noises played through an iPhone after the raw signals were processed on an Arduino. It was pretty fun.

## [Musician Maker](https://www.goshen.edu/academics/2012/02/29/miller-and-buschert-finalists-in-guthman-competition/) -- **Summer 2011**
[![Guthman](https://www.goshen.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/Guthman2012.jpg){:class="img-responsive" height="22%" width="22%"}](https://www.goshen.edu/academics/2012/02/29/miller-and-buschert-finalists-in-guthman-competition/)

During the summer of 2011 I worked on the "Musician Maker" project as part of Goshen College's [Maple Scholars Program](https://www.goshen.edu/academics/maple-scholars/). Musician Maker is an intuitive, computer-controlled system of novel instruments that allows non-musicians to improvise expressive music. During the winter of 2012 my advisor, John Buschert, and I competed and were selected as finalists in the [2012 Guthman New Musical Instrument Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YQF2KTMRPs) hosted at Georgia Tech.
